        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
        <p>
            <strong>Welcome to my corner of the web!</strong><br>
            I'm <b>Bethuel Sarmoi</b>, a passionate web developer with a knack for crafting
            elegant and functional digital experiences. By day, I'm dedicated to shaping young minds as a high school
            teacher,
            fostering a love for learning and empowering the next generation. By night (and weekends, and any spare
            moment
            really), I immerse myself in the dynamic world of web development.<br>

            Driven by a desire to merge creativity with technology, I specialize in front-end development, where I bring
            designs
            to life with clean code and intuitive user interfaces. Whether it's building responsive websites, developing
            interactive web applications, or optimizing user experiences, I thrive on the challenge of turning ideas
            into
            reality.<br>

            My journey into web development began as a personal passion, but it quickly evolved into a professional
            pursuit.
            With a foundation in education, I bring a unique perspective to my work, emphasizing clear communication,
            user-centric design, and continuous learning. I believe that great websites not only look good but also
            function
            seamlessly, providing value and delight to users across the digital landscape.<br>

            In addition to my technical skills, I'm a firm believer in collaboration and lifelong learning. I actively
            seek out
            opportunities to expand my knowledge, whether through online courses, workshops, or engaging with the
            vibrant
            developer community. I believe that the best solutions emerge through teamwork, creativity, and a
            willingness to
            embrace new technologies.<br>

            When I'm not coding or grading papers, you can find me exploring the great outdoors, experimenting with new
            recipes
            in the kitchen, or losing myself in a good book. Life is an adventure, and I approach each project with the
            same
            sense of curiosity and enthusiasm.<br>

            Whether you're a fellow developer, a potential employer, or simply curious about the world of web
            development, I
            invite you to explore my portfolio and connect with me. Let's collaborate, innovate, and create something
            amazing
            together.<br>
            <em>Thank you for visiting, and I look forward to connecting with you soon!</em>

            <details>
                <summary>Educational Resource Management System</summary>
                <p>
                    Develop a web application or platform that assists teachers in managing educational resources
                    effectively.
                    This system could include features such as lesson planning tools, curriculum mapping, resource
                    sharing among
                    teachers, assessment creation and tracking, and student progress monitoring. By integrating
                    user-friendly
                    interfaces and customizable features, this project aims to streamline administrative tasks for
                    teachers,
                    allowing them to focus more on student engagement and learning outcomes.

                <p>
                    Create an interactive online learning platform that offers engaging educational content across
                    various
                    subjects and grade levels. Incorporate multimedia elements such as videos, interactive quizzes, and
                    gamified
                    activities to make learning more enjoyable and effective. Additionally, implement features like
                    progress
                    tracking, personalized recommendations, and discussion forums to facilitate student collaboration
                    and
                    self-paced learning. This project aims to provide a dynamic and accessible learning environment for
                    students, complementing traditional classroom instruction and catering to diverse learning styles.

                <summary>Parent-Teacher Communication App</summary>
                <p>
                    Design and develop a mobile app or web-based platform that enhances communication between teachers
                    and
                    parents. This app could include features such as real-time messaging, event notifications,
                    attendance
                    tracking, academic performance updates, and appointment scheduling. By fostering transparent and
                    timely
                    communication, this project aims to strengthen the partnership between educators and parents,
                    leading to
                    better support for students' academic and social-emotional development. Additionally, incorporating
                    user
                    feedback mechanisms and analytics tools can help continually improve the app's functionality and
                    user
                    experience.
